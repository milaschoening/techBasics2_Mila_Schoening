## Class Notes:
- Active buzzer: produces sound when connected to power, has a built-in oscillator and fixed pitch
- Passive buzzer: needs an external signal to produce sound, different frequencies can be used to play different notes
- Ultrasonic distance sensor: uses sound waves to measure the distance to an object by sending out a signal and measuring the time until the echo returns
- Similar sensors: infrared sensor use IR light for detection and PIR (passive infrared) sensors detect thermal radiation (heat) from moving bodies 
- Push button: a digital input that changes its state when pressed
- Pull-down resistor: keeps the input signal LOW when the button is not pressed
- Pull-up resistor: keeps the input signal HIGH when the button is not pressed

Exercise 1: Passive Buzzer
- connect a passive buzzer to the Arduino
- use tone() to play different frequencies
- combine it with Serial Read to control the sound through serial input

Exercise 2: Play Melody
- use the Arduino IDE example
- the pithces.h file contains the corresponding frequency of each musical note 

Exercise 3: Ultrasonic distance sensor 
- use an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance to an object
- read sensor values and explore its detection range
possible applications: object avoidance, parking assistance or height measurements

Exercise 4: Button (pull-down)
- connect a push button to the Arduino with a 10k pull-down resistor
- read the button state using digitalRead() and display it in the Serial Monitor
- the signal is LOW when the button is not pressed and HIGH when it is pressed

Exercise 5: buttons + buzzer
- make an instrument with a passive buzzer and multiple buttons
- assign a different musical note to each button
